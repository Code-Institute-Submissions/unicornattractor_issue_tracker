# Unicorn Attracktor Tracker - issue tracker application

## Project Intro
Stream Four Project: Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Milestone Project

![alt text](https://github.com/JBroks/unicornattractor_issue_tracker/blob/master/design/gif/unicornattractor.gif "Gif")

This project is part of the 'Full Stack Frameworks with Django' module of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development course.

## Project Scope
To complete this module the task was to create an issue tracking application that allows users to submit their tickets.

Users are allowed to submit two types of tickets i.e. bugs and features. In order to prioritize their tickets users are able to upvote them. The more upvotes a ticket has the faster it will be look after by a developer. However, the difference is that bugs can be upvoted for free, while user has to donate minimum â‚¬5 to upvote a feature. Users are also able to comment on tickets.

Additional features were developed, these include: data dashboard, forum, like / dislike mechanism for forum, search bar.

## Project Overview

Project consists of the following sections:

**1. Homepage** - Containing 'Sign up' button when user is not authenticated and 'Add ticket' and 'Forum' buttons when user is logged into his / her account. Home page also contains description of main tracking app features, about Unicorn Attractor app section and Apple / Google store badges.

**2. Sign in form** - Page containing the form that enables user to log into their account to use the app.

**3. Sign up form** - Page containing the form that enables user to sign up for the Unicorn Attractor Issue Tracking app.
 
**4. All tickets page** - Page containing paginated tickets and filters that enable user to filter tickets by type and status.

**5. Single ticket view page** - Page containing a detail information about a given ticket, a comment form and paginated comments.

**6. Add / edit ticket page** - Page containing add / edit ticket form.

**7. Forum page** - Page containing paginated forum threads.

**8. Thread view page** - Page containing a single thread and all associated posts.

**9. Add / edit thread page** - Page containing add / edit thread form.

**10. Data dashboard page** - Page containing summary statistics and charts presenting analysis of all tickets submited by app users.

**11. Search results page** - Page containing any application content that matches the search term.

**12. Profile page** - Page containing user information, such as username, last seen (date and time), and all content that a given user added, commented, upvoted, liked or disliked.

**13. Edit profile page** - Page containing edit profile form that enables a user to upload a profile photo and update any personal information.

**14. Reset password pages** - Pages that display instructions on password reset and password reset form.

## UX

### UX Design

In this project I was aiming to achieve a simple and user friendly user design, while providing all required information. All sections are arranged in a logical order to provide intuitive user experience e.g. any content that users can review is placed under 'Explore' menu, while forms for creating new content are placed under 'Create' menu.

In keeping with the unicorn theme I decided on blue (`#2e3190`), purple (`#5854a5`, `#bcb3bf`), pink (`#e89e93`, `#fcdcd7`) pallete of colors. Additionally yellow (`#fcd731`), green (`#63d37b`), red (`#ee5140`) colors were used for the data dashboard and back to top button.

### Target Audience

This app was created to serve users of the (fictional) sourcing and recruiting application called "Unicorn Attractor". This application enables these users to submit any tickets describing the existing bugs and issues that they are having, as well as suggest any new features to be implemented.

Therefore, th main objective of the website is to provide a user with a tool that will enable them to submit tickets, upvote and donate for any features, comment tickets, create forum threads / posts, like threads / posts, review ticket statistics.

### User Stories

The following user stories were used to design this project:

**User Story 1:** As a user I would like to create an account to access all the app features such as e.g. ticket creation.

**User Story 2:** As a user I would like to be able to delete my account and all content added by me at any point.

**User Story 3:** As a user I would like to have an option to login and logout of my account so nobody else can access it.

**User Story 4:** As a user I would like to be able to add a ticket of any of both types (bug or feature).

**User Story 5:** As a user I would like to be able to donate to support any feature of my choice.

**User Story 6:** As a user I would like to be able to add a new or remove my upvote.

**User Story 7:** As a user I would like to be able to comment on any ticket submitted by me or any other user.

**User Story 8:** As a user I would like to be able to filter out specific tickets depending on their type or status.

**User Story 9:** As a user I would like to be able to search through the website content.

**User Story 10:** As a user I would like to be able to start a new discussion on the website's forum.

**User Story 11:** As a user I would like to be able to express my opinion on threads / post via like / dislike system.

**User Story 12:** As a user I would like to have an overview on the ticket progress and overall statistics.

**User Story 13:** As a user I would like to see all of my inputs within the app (i.e. tickets, comments, upvotes, likes / dislikes, threads, posts) in case I would like to edit or delete them.

**User Story 14:** As a user I would like to be able to edit my profile information.

**User Story 15:** As a user I would like to be able to reset my password in case I forget it.

## Database

### Database Type

#### SQLite

SQLite is a simple, very lightweight database management system used for the project to store data locally and test my application.

#### PostgreSQL

Heroku's PostgreSQL relational database was used for the project to store the data for the deployed application.

My database consists of the following tables: users, user profiles, tickets, comments, upvotes, donations, threads, posts, thread votes, post votes.

### Database Design

Picture below presents the database schema outlining structure of each collection and relationship between each collection.

![alt text](https://github.com/JBroks/unicornattractor_issue_tracker/blob/master/design/database-design/db-schema.png "database-schema")

The main point of database schema preparation was to think through the structure of each Django model. Django model is then coverted into SQL code and creates the database tables and fields.

The example of Django model below:
```python
class Ticket(models.Model):
    '''
    Ticket model that will store all the fields below in a tabel called 'Ticket'
    '''
    TYPE_CHOICES = (
        ('Bug', 'Bug'),
        ('Feature', 'Feature'),
        )
    STATUS_CHOICES = (
        ('Open', 'Open'),
        ('In Progress', 'In Progress'),
        ('Completed', 'Completed'),
        ('Closed', 'Closed'),
        )
    
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        null=True,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ticket_type = models.CharField(
        max_length=7,
        choices=TYPE_CHOICES)
    ticket_status = models.CharField(
        max_length=11,
        choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
    subject = models.CharField(
        max_length=100,
        blank=False)
    description = models.TextField(
        max_length=30000,
        blank=False)
    date_created = models.DateTimeField(
        blank=False,
        null=False,
        auto_now_add=True)
    date_updated = models.DateTimeField(
        blank=False,
        null=False,
        auto_now=True,
        )
        
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-id']
```

## Testing

### Code validation

#### CSS

CSS code was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). It is important to mention that I only validated my custom code and not the Bootstrap modules.

No errors were found in the code.

#### HTML

HTML code was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

The following issues were captured by the validator:

- For most of the templates this issue appeared:
    ```
    Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections.
    ```
    This warning was ignored as no additional heading is required.
    
- The following issue was highlighted for the homepage template:
    ```
    Consider using the h1 element as a top-level heading only (all h1 elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools).
    ```
    This warning was ignored as h1 was purposely put by me inside the jumbotrone element.

All warnings related to Jinja templates syntax were ignored as they are not recognised by the HTML validator.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript code was validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

Validator has indicated that there are two unknown / undefined variables, namely `$`, and `Stripe`. The warning was ignored as I believe it is due to the fact that these libraries are separated and the validator does not have access to them.

#### Python

Python code was validated using[PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com). All errors and warnings were fixed to validate the code agains the PEP8 requirements.

The only warning that was not fixed in some cases was the following:
```
blank line contains whitespace
```

This issue apppeared when I added spaces between some blocks of code to make it more readable, which is allowed as per the following PEP8 rule:
**"Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions."**
