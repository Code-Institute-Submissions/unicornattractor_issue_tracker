# Unicorn Attracktor Issue Tracker - issue tracker application

## About
Stream Four Project: Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Milestone Project

![alt text](paste gif link "Gif")

This project is part of the 'Full Stack Frameworks with Django' module of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development course.

## Scope
To complete this module the task was to create an issue tracking application that allows users to submit their tickets. Users are allowed to submit two types of tickets i.e. bugs and features. In order to prioritize their tickets users are able to upvote them. The more upvotes a ticket has the faster it will be look after by a developer.
However, the difference is that bugs can be upvoted for free, while user has to donate minimum â‚¬5 to upvote a feature. Users are also able to comment on tickets.
Additional features were developed, these include: data dashboard, forum, like / dislike mechanism for forum, search bar.
